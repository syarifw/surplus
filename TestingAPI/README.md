## How to Run in Local 
### Prerequisites
1. Python installed (>= 3.7)
2. `pip` (or `pip3`), `virtualenv` installed
3. Clone this repo
4. Run `virtualenv .` => this will create python virtual env in that directory (so it doesn't messed up with other python environment, if you have any others)

### Step by Step
1. Go to TestingAPI path directory
2. Run `python <TestFile>.py` which you need to run the test
3. The result of the test will be prompt on CLI as a logs
4. After you finish, run `deactivate` to terminate the virtualenv
